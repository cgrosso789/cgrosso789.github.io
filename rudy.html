                    and he could accomplish anything he wanted to.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    And what he wanted to do was to help his neighbors, be an electrical engineer 
                    and drive a big boat.

                <p>
                    He had an enormously tender heart, coupled with an attitude and a sharp wit.  He was
                    generous and kind, fiercely competitive and passionately loyal. His wife Laura of 36
                    years was his best friend, and he was loved and respected by everyone who knew him.

                    I love you and miss you so much, Rudy. There truly was only ever one you. But I'll 
                    see you again someday, so until then...party with Jesus and save me a seat.

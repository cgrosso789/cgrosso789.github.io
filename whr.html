                <p>
                    I can&#39;t wait to take my dog Wilson for a walk in the <b>woods</b>
                    everyday just for the chance to catch some critter unawares
                    &#40;even though having Wilson in tow makes that less likely&#41;&#33; I&#39;ve managed to take
                    <b>pictures</b> of quite a few of them, but there are 
                    probably a hundred more, from deer to muskrats to spotted newts &#40;and even a 
                    <b>Bald Eagle</b>, once&#33;&#41; of which I have no photo record.  But they all hang out 
                    here--or at least temporarily visit--in my yard&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; I have to pinch myself 
                    sometimes &#128522;&#33; In any case, I&#39;ve included many here for you to enjoy. 
                    &#40;All except two of these photos actually come from <b>my yard</b>, but since I have seen 
                    the animals represented in those photos here, as well, I decided 
                    to include them anyway.&#41;
                </p>
                <p>I have to say that this <b>obsession</b> of mine with animals started a long time ago.  My 
                    parents were too practical to want pets; but they had me, and thus had to endure the 
                    begging for YEARS until they could take it no longer and relented.  I had a <b>rabbit</b> at 
                    first.  I took THAT for walks, too; no leash--it followed me wherever I went. Then, 
                    my brother and I had <a href=
                    "http://windsorlocks.advantage-preservation.com/viewer/?k=peiser&t=32210&i=t&d=01011880-12311974&m=between&ord=k1&fn=windsor_locks_journal_usa_connecticut_windsor_locks_19730927_english_1&df=1&dt=10">
                    squirrels</a>--seriously&#33; &#40;See the front page article entitled, &#34;<b>Rescued</b>.&#34; 
                    The photo is junk, but the &#34;Christine&#34; person is me.&#41; Then I finally got a 
                    <b>dog</b>: a belligerent but very intelligent Alaskan Malamute that I loved with all my heart, 
                    and which put my dog education into overdrive.  Fast-forward to marriage, 
                    kids&#46;&#46;&#46;and more dogs. First a sweet Rottweiler that my friends called &#34;<b>The 
                    LickWeiler</b>.&#34; Then a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog that I owner-handled to a champion 
                    title and bred. You can see her picture on <a href=
                    "https://www.jotunheimswissies.com/blaze.html">this site</a>--her registered
                    name was Sunhaven&#39;s Miss Moneypenny.  &#40;Her championship was acknowleged at the 
                    GSMDCA National specialty, <a href=
                    "http://www.gsmdca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2005-awards-program-MASTER.pdf">here</a>, 
                    under <i>Owner-Handled Champions.</i>&#41; When I walked THIS dog, our <b>cat</b> would often come 
                    with us, <i>as well as</i> a handful of <b>chickens</b>; no lie.  
                    &#40;My brother should have nicknamed me &#34;<b>Snow White</b>.&#34;&#41;
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I seriously digress.  We now have a lovable lab/coonhound mix named &#34;Wilson&#34; who adores 
                    all human beings, <b>chases airplanes</b> and accompanies me on critter-walks.  Would you like 
                    to come along?  Scroll down, and feel free to exit if you get bored; however, I hope you 
                    make it to the bottom of the page and are able to view the <b>movie of the beaver</b>&#33;&#33;

                Wow!  There was a bear in our woods!!  This was spring time, so it was probably
                hungry, and it's best I didn't run into him or her in person!

            <figcaption>
                I saw a moose in the backyard once about 15 years ago; there is hardly a greater 
                thrill to be had (by me, anyway)! This track, however, was left this past spring by
                a moose sneaking through the previous night.

                Running foxes leave a trail of tracks that make a nearly-straight line.

                Although squirrels are so common here that only Wilson is terribly excited to see them,
                still--I love to see the impression of ANY tracks in soft, shallow, spring snow.

                My broody Bielefelder hen tends to hatch out pretty-much only roosters, which I don't 
                need.  This spring, I cleverly augmented her newly-hatched family with sexed pullets 
                (female chicks) from Tractor Supply.  Of course, a fox came by a few weeks later 
                and ate all but one of the pullet chicks (and none of the roosters) &#129324;.

                I LOVE a beautiful pallet of eggs almost as much as I love a beautiful pallet of fabrics!

                Morel mushrooms are a delicacy, and we get them growing in the same spot most years.
                They produce their fruiting body (the mushroom) in the spring (most mushrooms come out 
                in the fall).

                Most Amanita mushrooms are poisonous, and some Amanitas are deadly.  There are,

                Maybe you will think this video is dumb.  It made me laugh, because the dog is 
                playing a game, and the rooster means business! (And it's only 8 seconds long, so
                what have you got to lose?)

                This was, for sure, better than an IMAX nature film.  I know I spewed out a lot
                of inane babbling at the poor creature, but I wanted to see if he was bold enough to 
                stay around even if I were talking.  He was!  (I think the slap was to tell me to get lost,
                though!)

            My former boyfriend (now husband) and I took a course on mushrooming through the Appalacian
            Mountain Club in the White Mountains of New Hampshire back in the fall of 1985. I believe
            the instructor's name was Arnie Benson.  I will never forget what he told us: "There are
            old mushroom hunters, and there are bold mushroom hunters, but there are no old, bold 
            mushroom hunters."

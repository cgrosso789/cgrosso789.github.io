            <h2>This is my son Rob.</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>
                    His business is called Revolution Tree Works, and it operates in the DFW
                    Metroplex in Texas.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Rob is a <b>USMC veteran</b> and has a BS in Business Administration.  He 
                    learned to climb trees here in New Hampshire, and then "put his passions to
                    work" by training under a former work-associate in Fort Worth to learn the tree 
                    business.  He has been very busy ever since!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the name of his business and the emblem he flies on his flag (seen in the
                    video, below) are derived from 
                    the historic <b>Pine Tree Riot</b>, which happened in Weare, NH, in 1772.  You can read
                    about it here: 
                    <a href="https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/new-hampshire-pine-tree-riot-1772/">Pine Tree Riot of 1772</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Incidentally, this same historic event was also an inspiration to the Able Ebenezer Brewing 
                    Company, whose delicious beer is brewed right here in Southern New Hampshire. If you are interested,
                    you can learn more about <b>their own reasons for being inspired by this story</b> here:

                This video was generously made and gifted to Rob by a client of his with a lot of talent
                and a drone! My other kids
                have been bungee-jumping; not sure if <b>swinging through trees with chain saws</b> is any less
                exciting than that&#46;&#46;&#46;&#128556;

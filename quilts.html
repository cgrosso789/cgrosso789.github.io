                This king-sized quilt was made for my son Rob and my daughter-in-law Elizabeth
                for their wedding from a pattern called 
                &#34;Radiance,&#34; &#169; 2016 Project House 360, and designed by Christine Stainbrook. 
                The top was machine-pieced by me, and machine-quilted by Jessie Sweeney of 
                Coda Quilting, Nashua, NH.

                It was in Copley Place in Boston that I first fell in love&#46;&#46;&#46;
            </h2>
            <article>
                <h3>
                    I don&#39;t remember what I was doing in the city that particular day in 1983 or 84,

                    but it caught my eye from within a display window inside the elegant, high-end mall.
                    It was blue and white, and all crinkly and soft-looking. It was made of triangles and
                    squares, and seemed as though someone&#39;s great-grandmother may have lovingly stitched it
                    together by a fireplace, and that it had since seen both joys and hardships of
                    years past along with the family that had taken nightly refuge under it.
                    It was stunning. And I knew right then that I had to learn to quilt.

                <p>
                    The first quilt book I ever owned I purchased a few years later in a used book store in 
                    Bar Harbor, Maine, entitled, not surprisinly, <i>Folk Quilts and How to Recreate Them</i>, by Audrey &#38;
                    Douglas Wiss. It was pretty-much instruction-free, but contained within its wonderous pages
                    beautiful pictures of antique quilts. It was not actually until I had had my first child and
                    stayed at home that I was able to pursue my new passion, and discovered, to my glee, that 
                    there existed quilting guilds and shops aplenty in the world! The guilds existed for people
                    like me, and to keep quilting alive; the shops existed for us to happily throw whatever
                    money they wanted at them in exchange for an artist&#39;s pallet of wonderful fabrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since those early days, I have made probably 100 or more quilts of various sizes and--how shall
                    we say it--&#34;loveliness levels.&#34;  I rarely photographed them, and most of them were 
                    given away as gifts. I find that, mostly, I do not lament my lack of pictorial records of 
                    my endeavors, because the endeavors were never about my glory, but about sharing what I 
                    considered special and precious with someone whom I wanted to make feel supremely loved.  
                    However, now that I am making this website, more pictures of the good, the bad and even
                    the ugly would have been really nice!!  Come and take a peek at a few things anyway!

                Lining up choices of fabric for possible inclusion into my next project, a bargello quilt.
                The open book that is partially seen is <i>Twist-and-Turn Bargello Quilts</i>, &#169; 2009 
                by Eileen Wright, Martingale&#174; &#38; Company.  Pattern seen is called &#34;Surf Song.&#34; 
                After choosing or creating a design, this is the next step in quilt-making, and often happens
                in a fabric shop as one is surrounded by hundreds of bolts of fabric&#33;

                This is quilt is being hand-quilted, one of the final steps in the project.
                The quilting pattern is marked lightly onto the fabric, and the short needle is literally 
                wiggled back and forth through the quilt layers, which adds texture and interest, 
                as well as securing the layers. I am forever indebted to the now-renowned
                <a href="https://www.ctpub.com/carol-doak/">Carol Doak</a> 
                for teaching me how to hand-quilt at the Covered Bridge Quilt Shop in 
                Nashua, NH, about 30 years ago. A recipient of a hand-quilted quilt is blessed indeed.

                This quilt was made by me for my son Kevin for his college graduation. &#40;Unfortunately, I&#39;ve
                misplaced the book from which I took the pattern design; if anyone who reads this recognizes 
                the pattern, I would be grateful if they could <a href="mailto:rottypal@yahoo.com">email me</a>
                and remind me of the name and author of the book.&#41; The blue flannel penguin fabric which you
                can see a bit of on the back of the quilt is reminiscent of Kevin&#39;s semester in New 
                Zealand, in which he spent quite a bit of time surfing with both new friends and penguins.
                The quilt was machine- and hand-pieced, and machine- and hand-quilted by me.

                This whimsical daschund quilt pattern was designed by Elizabeth Hartman, &#169; 2017, and entitled, &#34;Dogs
                in Sweaters.&#34; It was machine-pieced by me and machine-quilted by Jessie Sweeney. It was
                a gift to my great-nephew Aadrik on the occasion of his birth.

                This quilt is an original design by me.  The sailboat block is a traditional one, and I actually
                made two mirror-image quilts &#40;but only photographed one&#41; for the newborn identical twin
                grandsons of a friend whose son-in-law is in the Coast Guard. I purposely made the quilts
                to be &#34;the same, but different,&#34; and made Coast Guard cutters for the center blocks.  It
                was machine-pieced and -quilted by me.

                I made this quilt for my granddaughter Evelyn on the occasion of her birth.  The pattern is
                called &#34;Blue Lagoon,&#34; and was designed by Bea Lee &#169; 2018, of Beaquilter. The 
                cover design of the pattern is, as you might expect, in blue; I made mine in pink and 
                purple.  It looks like an optical illusion, which made me think she might grow up to 
                have a &#34;math brain&#34; like her grandma&#33; I machine-pieced the top and Jessie 
                Sweeney machine-quilted it. Grandpa is holding up the quilt, on which his hat brim sits&#33;

                This quilt took forever to make; it is a mosaic design of 1-inch squares, extrapolated from a
                cross-stitch pattern purchased at least 20 years ago.  &#40;This pattern, too, I&#39;ve long-since 
                lost; if the design looks familiar and you can identify the creator, please 
                <a href="mailto:rottypal@yahoo.com">email me</a>.  Many thanks&#33;&#41; There is
                a design flaw in the cross-stitch pattern, next to the ear; I wished yesterday, 
                when I took the photo, that I had been
                brave enough to fix it before I made the quilt.  Ah, well&#46;&#46;&#46;
                too late now&#33; The quilt is 
                a tribute to my sweet Rottweiler Mindy, who will always be my favorite dog
                &#40;but don&#39;t tell Wilson that, please&#41;&#33; It was machine-pieced by me and
                machine-quilted by Jessie Sweeney.

    <aside>
        For many years, I tried to keep up with all the new babies at church, having determined that
        each should have a handmade quilt from me&#33; I made good on my promise to myself for probably
        five years, until conflicting passions of mine &#40;namely, our first show dog, and two years
        later, the adoption of our precious daughter from China&#41; caused me to tuck away quilting 
        for about nine years.

            <h2>Boston University was an amazing place at which to &#34;retool.&#34;</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>I began my &#34;come-back journey&#34; in January of 2018 with C++ 
                    classes at Nashua Community College,</h3>
                <p>
                    and it was there that a professor suggested I ought to go to grad school at BU.
                    The next day, after the shock of <i>that</i> novel idea had worn off, I concluded he was
                    absolutely right&#33; 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My professor had originally suggested I study CS. But while checking the BU course catalog,
                    I noticed that they had something called an MSSD.  Software development was REALLY what I 
                    wanted to do, and I had never heard of an MSSD before.  Eight courses and no thesis.  
                    How tough could that be?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right. I&#39;d missed out on quite a few years of IT, 
                    so I had to scramble to keep up, and considering the intensity of the learning,
                    most nights I&#39;d burn the 3 a.m. oil. As
                    I&#39;ve told my kids, &#34;Nothing worthwhile 
                    ever comes cheap.&#34; Graduate school at Boston University has 
                    been the embodiment of that expression, and I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity 
                    to study here.  Below I&#39;ve listed the courses I&#39;ve taken
                    and the term project that I did for each.  Where able, I&#39;ve included a link to
                    further information about that project. I am most proud of the Quilt Fabric Estimator
                    project; I loved the Design Patterns course.
